    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, two tablespoons parsley, basil, one teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about one and a half hours, stirring occasionally</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining two tablespoons parsley, and half teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread one and a half cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with one third of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon one and a half cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with a quarter cup Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving</li>
    </ol>
